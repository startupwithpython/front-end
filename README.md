front-end practice

this is a record of my practice of programing,I am planing to work as an IT engnieer instead of civil engineer.
## html
I want to begin with html. Html is not a programing language, it is a markup language with documents structure. Similar to **Markdown**, But the difference is that html has much more complicated syntax and it can build richer pages.

## My way of study
I have learned about html, css, javascript online and have a brief understanding of it. But I didn't have much project experiences. I found that Molliza has made a leading learning pages for web developer. MDN has such advantages:
+ opensource
+ community
+ up to date
